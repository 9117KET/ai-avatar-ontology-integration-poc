    "question": "A stone dropped from the roof of a building to the surface of Earth:",
    "options": "A) Reaches a maximum speed quite soon after release and then falls at a constant speed thereafter.\nB) Speeds up as it falls because the gravitational attraction becomes considerably stronger as the stone gets closer to Earth.\nC) Speeds up because of an almost constant force of gravity acting on it.\nD) Falls because of the natural tendency of all objects to rest on the surface of Earth.\nE) Falls because of the combined effects of the force of gravity, air pressure, and the total mass of the object.",
