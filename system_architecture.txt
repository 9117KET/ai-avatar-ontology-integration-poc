# AI Physics Tutor - System Architecture
=======================================

1. System Overview
-----------------
The AI Physics Tutor is a streamlined educational platform that combines ontology-based physics knowledge representation with the Claude 3 Large Language Model (LLM) to deliver accurate and helpful physics tutoring. The architecture follows a clean, modular design pattern with a focus on a simple, effective chat interface.

2. Core Components
-----------------
2.1. Main Application Layer
    - Flask-based web application (app.py)
    - Synchronous HTTP request handling (migrated from Quart)
    - Robust error handling and security features
    - Enhanced security headers and SSL certificate management
    - Session management with JWT tokens

2.2. API Layer
    - Streamlined RESTful endpoint (/api/ask)
    - Comprehensive request validation
    - Tiered error handling with specific status codes
    - JSON response formatting
    - Rate limiting for API protection

2.3. LLM Integration Layer
    - Claude 3 AI integration
    - Simplified student model for concept tracking
    - Synchronous conversation handling
    - Physics-focused response formatting
    - Ontology-enhanced context generation

2.4. Physics Ontology System
    - OWL/RDF knowledge representation
    - Physics domain concept modeling
    - Prerequisite relationships
    - Core physics principles and formulas
    - Concept hierarchies and relationships

3. Data Flow Architecture
------------------------
3.1. Client Request Flow
    Client → Flask Server → AI Tutor → Ontology Integration → Physics-Enhanced Response

3.2. Chat Session Flow
    1. User submits physics question via chat interface
    2. Server validates input and session parameters
    3. System retrieves or creates student model instance
    4. Claude 3 LLM processes question with ontology context
    5. Ontology provides structured physics knowledge
    6. System enhances the response with formula formatting
    7. Student model records exposed concepts
    8. Returns response with appropriate physics formatting

4. Integration Components
-----------------------
4.1. Claude-Ontology Integration
    - Physics concept disambiguation
    - Formula verification and representation
    - Context-aware physics explanations
    - Retrieval of relevant physics principles
