      "question": "Hello, how can you be of help to me, can you be my terapy?",
      "response": "Hello! While I would be happy to help explain physics concepts and provide a friendly ear, I want to clarify that as an AI physics tutor, I cannot provide professional therapy services. If you are looking for emotional support or mental health assistance, I recommend speaking with a qualified therapist, counselor or doctor.\n\nThat said, I'm here to help with any physics questions you may have! Physics can sometimes seem daunting, but by breaking concepts down step-by-step and relating them to real-world examples, I aim to make the subject more approachable and understandable. \n\nFor example, Newton's laws of motion, which are some of the most fundamental principles in physics, govern many aspects of the world around us. When you ride in a car, walk down the street, or throw a ball, forces are at play according to Newton's laws. Having an intuitive grasp of concepts like inertia, F=ma, and equal and opposite forces can help make sense of motion and interactions you observe every day.\n\nSo while I can't be a therapist, I'm happy discuss physics in relatable terms and work through any questions or confusions you may have about the laws of motion, kinematics, or other introductory physics topics. Let me know what aspects of physics you'd like to explore!",
